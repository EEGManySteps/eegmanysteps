Timestamp	1. Step-specific time-frequency pattern Summary: Gait events, such as initial and final contacts, will be derived from multiple datasets. Time-frequency decompositions locked to these events will be analyzed, with potentially influencing factors parameterized.	2. Characterization of gait artifacts across different systems Summary:  Based on known parameters for assessing signal quality during gait, we can assess whether and how gait-related artifacts vary across different hardware systems and laboratories.	3. Influence of preprocessing on EEG results during walking Summary:  Compare the  impact of various defendable  preprocessing  pipelines on gait-related spectral perturbations (GRSP) and event-related potentials (ERP) across multiple hardware setups and laboratories.	4. Gait-related modulation of secondary task correlates Summary:  Can we  replicate often- reported modulations of EEG dynamics underlying cognitive task performance, e.g. reduced P3 amplitudes during walking?

Characterization of gait artifacts across different systems" might be difficult to really pinpoint as there are multiple factors that are different between labs and different subjects are tested. If you're looking for a manipulation that could be performed at all sites and that would be reasonably comparable everywhere, perhaps a manipulation of  'gait speed' is of interest. That might also give more insights into 2. the specific artifacts that might be expected under different conditions, and 1. the parameters that affect the time-frequency representation. Another interesting comparison could be treadmill-based vs overground walking, which would also relate to 1 and 2.
