These datasets will be selected based on their relevance to gait-related studies and their potential for integration.\n\n2. **Standardization**: A protocol will be developed to assess and harmonize the data from various sources, ensuring that the collected data adheres to a common format. This protocol will facilitate the conversion of data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format.\n\n3. **Data Format**: All data will be converted to the BIDS format and made available on OpenNeuro, an open-access database that supports the sharing and re-use of neuroimaging data. This will enhance the accessibility and utility of the data for future research.\n\n4. **Community Engagement**: We invite contributions from researchers worldwide, including data, knowledge, and feedback. By fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment, we aim to build a comprehensive understanding of how different EEG setups impact findings.\n\n### Expected Outcomes and Future Directions\n\n**EEGManySteps** aims to achieve several key outcomes:\n\n- **Enhanced Understanding**: Gain insights into the variability of EEG results across different experimental setups, with a focus on mobile brain imaging and gait-related components.\n- **Standardized Protocols**: Develop and refine protocols for integrating EEG data from various sources, contributing to more consistent and reliable EEG research practices.\n- **Open-Access Database**: Create a large, open-access database of EEG data that will serve as a valuable resource for the neuroscience community, enabling further exploration and validation of findings.\n\n### Future Directions\n\nMoving forward, **EEGManySteps** aspires to:\n\n- **Expand Scope**: Include additional datasets and experimental paradigms to broaden the understanding of EEG variability in mobile applications.\n- **Develop Prediction Tools**: Consider implementing prediction markets or other forecasting tools to involve the EEG community in predicting the impact of different setups on research outcomes.\n- **Foster Collaboration**: Promote the formation of multi-laboratory collaborations to tackle new challenges in EEG research, enhancing the overall robustness of the field.\n\nThrough these efforts, **EEGManySteps** aims to contribute significantly to the field of mobile brain imaging, driving advancements in research methodologies and fostering a culture of inclusive, high-powered collaborations.\n\n\n# Organisation\n\nThe EEGManySteps project is lead by a steering commitee consisting of experienced researchers from the MoBI community.\nAdditionally, there are 5 work packages (WPs) which take care of specific tasks.\n\n## Steering commitee members\n- [Bettina Wollesen](mailto:bettina.wollesen@uni-hamburg.de?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n- [Edmund Wascher](mailto:wascher@ifado.de?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n- [Fiorenzo Artoni](mailto:?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n- [Janna Protzak](mailto:?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n- [John Iversen](mailto:?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n- [Klaus Gramann](mailto:klaus.gramann@tu-berlin.de?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n- [Mathias Vukelic](mailto:mathias.vukelic@iao.fraunhofer.de?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n- [Stefan Debener](mailto:stefan.debener@uol.de?subject=EEGManyLabs)\n\n\n## Workpackages\n1.
