    "text": "Start of the Initiative\nWe invite you to collaborate on the EEGManySteps initiative, aimed at understanding how different setups in mobile electroencephalography (EEG) experiments influence the results. EEGManySteps is an international, inter-institute effort focused on collecting and analyzing EEG data across multiple laboratories to investigate these influences, starting with a specific focus on gait-related features.\nWe are currently forming the decision-making structure of the initiative, which may change through further open discussions.\n\nHow to Participate\nPlease let us know via email (eegmanysteps@gmail.com) if you would like to assume one of the following roles:\n\nSteering Committee Member\nAdvisory Board Member\nData Set Contributor\nAnalyst\n\nEach role is described below. Please note that the roles of Steering Committee Member and Advisory Board Member cannot be chosen simultaneously. The final decision on your commitment can follow after some period when the responsibilities are better defined with mutual agreement.\n\n\nTentative Role Definitions\nSteering Committee Members\nExpected to attend monthly meetings and take on specific tasks within the project. Minimal requirement: Authorship in one or more peer-reviewed MoBI paper or extensive experience in similar open science projects. Minimum active period at least 1 year.\nAdvisory Board Members: Provide background support and feedback during quarterly/biannual meetings to guide the project’s direction. Minimal requirement: First or last author in a peer-reviewed MoBI/Biomechanics paper or extensive experience in similar open science projects. Minimum active period at least 1 year.\nData Set Contributors\nProvide access to EEG datasets recorded in mobile settings. Detailed requirements are still to be determined.\nMinimal requirement: Responsible for the acquisition, curation, or formatting of mobile EEG data.\nAnalysts\nParticipate in analyzing specific research questions related to mobile EEG data.\nMinimal requirement: Experience with the analysis of biomechanical or MoBI data.\n\n\nUpcoming Event\nWe also invite you to join the virtual Kick-off Meeting in September, with the exact date and time to be determined through a poll. Please email us to access the poll and receive the meeting link."

    "text": "Mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) is a burgeoning field enabling researchers to study brain activity in naturalistic settings. Electroencephalography (EEG), a popular method for MoBI due to its portability, often faces challenges related to inconsistent experimental setups and data processing pipelines. This can hinder the reproducibility of findings. The EEGManySteps initiative aims to address these issues by investigating how different experimental setups and analysis methods can influence results. By understanding the impact of acquisition and analysis protocols, we seek to enhance the consistency and reliability of EEG research in mobile environments. We are committed to fostering Open Science by ensuring our research materials, including data sets and software, are publicly accessible and well-documented. This will enable other researchers to build upon our work, and contribute to the advancement of MoBI."
